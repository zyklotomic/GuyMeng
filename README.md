# GuyMeng 街名

Before being ceded back to China on the midnight of July 1st, 1997, Hong Kong was British territory.
British control over the territory has left tangible influences on the city that remain to this day.
Hong Kong culture can be described as a fusion of Chinese and British characteristics.
I especially enjoyed watching [Vox's Borders series on Hong Kong](https://youtu.be/StW7oGSR_Mg). Johnny
Harris, the journalist behind
the series, does a great job of explaining this culture, way better than I can do. His work is truly amazing.

One example of this intersection of cultures I was interested in exploring was the street names of Hong Kong.
In the originally British territory of Hong Kong, discounting the New Territories up north, major arteries
with English names are interwoven with Cantonese roads. In the northern New Territories that were never under
British occupation, all the street names are in Cantonese. What I wanted to do was visualize the location
of all the British and Cantonese streets.

I pulled GeoJson data on the street geometries of Hong Kong from OpenStreetMaps. Then, I used a Python script that
I wrote to manually enter in metadata for each street regarding whether the language was English, Chinese, or Neutral.
